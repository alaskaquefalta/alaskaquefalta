I'm Alaska, a mathematical researcher and industrial engineering student based in Brasil.

I've been coding in C, R and Python. I'm self-taught! I'm also really proficient in LaTeX!

I'm currently learning both Octave and Fortran! 

My goal is to learn all I can to collaborate and contribute to the fields I'm working on as much as possible!

Currently working on a project about Subdivision Schemes and Applications. Ask me about it!

I can be reached through my socials, all of which are @alaskaquefalta !

**Fun Facts:**

- I have two cats: Leopoldo and Pérola!
- My favorite anime is Given and my favorite manga is Demon Slayer.
- My first contact with college level maths was with Real Analysis, and it became my favorite subject!
